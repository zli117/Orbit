## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# Admin user (optional) - this username becomes admin on login
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin

# Fitbit OAuth (optional)
FITBIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

## Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides user management and security monitoring.

### Designating an Admin

Set the `ADMIN_USERNAME` environment variable to the username that should have admin privileges:

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=myusername
```

When that user logs in, they are automatically granted admin status.

### Admin Features

- **User Management**
  - View all registered users
  - Disable/enable user accounts (disabled users cannot log in)
  - Grant or revoke admin privileges
  - Permanently delete users (cascades to all their data)

- **Query Execution Logs**
  - View all custom query executions
  - Filter by user, success/failure, date range
  - See execution time and error messages
  - Audit trail for security monitoring

- **Statistics**
  - Total users, disabled users, admin count
  - Query executions (24h and 7d)
  - Error rates and average execution times

### Security

- All admin endpoints require `isAdmin: true`
- Cannot disable/delete your own account
- Disabling a user invalidates all their sessions
- Query code is sandboxed with QuickJS (WASM)
- Rate limiting: 30 queries/minute per user
- Code size limit: 100KB max

## Production Deployment

### Docker

```bash
# Build and run
docker compose up -d

# With admin user
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin docker compose up -d
```

## Database
